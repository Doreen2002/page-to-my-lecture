    <h1 style="color:tomato;">HE INSPIRED MY &hearts; FOR CODING </h1>
    
    <div class="story">It was in 2018 when i was looking for a course i was going to do,
         having gotten 18 points i knew i was not going to get a nice paying 
         career so basically i just decided to do anything that was related to math since 
         math was math was my favorite. so my siters friend advised i study computer science for teachers 
         since it involved some math i agreed. i got accepted to study at evelyn hone college. thats when everthing changed for me.<br>
         As i was planning to start my first academic year for 2019 i started going throught course modules, then found this interesting
         module called Introduction to Programming. One thing that amazed me in this module was definition of programming i got curious
         wanted to know how can one pass instructions to the computer it was abit confusing so i said to myself any i will know once i get to school.
         <br>
         finally my academic year start and i reported for class upon first reporting i met this amazing person Mr GAD BWALYA,
          he basically came to introduce himself as our programming lecture. I was super excited to start learning this thing so called programming.
          So i made sure i followed him up asked things i needed to start learning how to code and i thank GOD because he helped me in every way.
          He got me started with learning C++ and told me these words i will never forget he said "i hope you wont quit cause i dont deal with quitter"
          and i remeber promising him i was never going to quit. To cut story short i am gratefull mr GAD for teaching me how to code.
          I am not yet a pro programmer but i can proudly say i know how to print hello world in C++.
          You helped give a new definition to my life.<br>
          cout<<"thank you sir";
